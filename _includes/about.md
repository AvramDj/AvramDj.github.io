I'm a machine learning research engineer, but also do a lot of swe, architecture, and devops work. 

I'm both an engineer and mathematician at heart, and I love to build things. I also do independent research and enjoy tinkering with new ideas, replicating new exciting state of the art things in pytorch, and playing around with the latest and greatest.

I'm particularly interested in:

- LLMs, diffusion models, and other generative models
- Classic machine learning algorithms and their modern incarnations
- High-precision specialized ML systems for assisting humans with sensitive tasks
- Model interpretability and explainability
- Software engineering and architecture
- Optimizing systems at a low level for performance and efficiency (CUDA, compilers, etc.)
- Distributed systems and very large-scale training
- DevOps and automation

You can DM me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/avramdjo) if you have any interesting ideas or opportunities.
