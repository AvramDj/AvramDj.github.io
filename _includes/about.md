<!-- Hi, I'm Avram. People on the internet call me nord. -->

I work as a machine learning engineer, primarily research and development, but also a fair bit of software engineering, architecture, and devops work. 

I'm both an engineer and mathematician at heart, and I love to build things. I also do independent research and love tinkering with new ideas, implementing papers in pytorch, and hacking on new SOTA models.

I'm particularly interested in:

- LLMs, diffusion models, and other generative models
- High precision specialized ML systems for automating sensitive tasks
- Model interpretability and explainability
- Mathematical foundations of deep learning and geometric deep learning
- Software engineering and architecture
- Optimizing systems for performance and efficiency
- Distributed systems
- DevOps and automation

You can DM me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/avramdjo) if you have any interesting ideas or opportunities.
