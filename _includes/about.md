<!-- Hi, I'm Avram. People on the internet call me Nord. -->

I work as a machine learning engineer, primarily in research and development, but also a lot of software engineering, architecture, and DevOps work. 

I'm both an engineer and mathematician at heart, and I love to build things. I also do independent research and enjoy tinkering with new ideas, implementing papers in PyTorch, and experimenting with new SOTA.

I'm particularly interested in:

- LLMs, diffusion models, and other generative models
- High-precision specialized ML systems for automating sensitive tasks
- Model interpretability and explainability
- Mathematical foundations of deep learning and geometric deep learning
- Software engineering and architecture
- Optimizing systems for performance and efficiency
- Distributed systems
- DevOps and automation

You can DM me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/avramdjo) if you have any interesting ideas or opportunities.
