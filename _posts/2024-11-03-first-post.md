I plan to use this blog to write about my work and thoughts on machine learning, research, engineering, the current state of things, and whatever else I find interesting.

Most experienced practitioners have knowledge trees that they've grown over the years, and I'm no different. So, I'll use this blog as a place to record my thoughts and share what I've learned. 

Hopefully, I'll commit to writing more often, but don't hold me to it.
