I plan on using this blog to write about my work and thoughts on machine learning, research, and engineering.

Most experienced practitioners have knowledge trees that they've built up over the years, and I'm no different. So I'll use this blog as a place to record my thoughts and share what I've learned. Hopefully I'll commit to writing more often, but don't hold me to it.
