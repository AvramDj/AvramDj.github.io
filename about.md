Hi, I'm Avram Djordjevic.

I'm passionate about machine learning research, particularly focusing on state-of-the-art developments in the field. My interests span across:

- Machine Learning Research & Deep Learning
- Mathematical Foundations of ML
- Compiler Design & Implementation
- Programming Language Theory

I enjoy exploring the theoretical aspects of machine learning and their practical applications. When I'm not diving into ML research papers or working on mathematical proofs, I'm often experimenting with compiler design and implementation.

You can find me on:

Feel free to reach out if you'd like to discuss ML research, math, or compilers!
