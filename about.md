Hi, I'm Avram Djordjevic.

My research interests lie at the intersection of machine learning and mathematics. I'm particularly focused on:

- Deep Learning & Neural Architectures
- Mathematical Foundations of ML/AI
- Large Language Models
- Compiler Design

I write about ML research, implementation details of interesting papers, and occasionally about compiler theory.
