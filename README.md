My personal blog built with Jekyll.

## Writing Posts

1. Create a new file in `_posts/` with the format: `YYYY-MM-DD-title.md`
2. Add the frontmatter:
   ```yaml
   ---
   layout: post
   title: "Your Post Title"
   date: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS +/-TTTT
   ---
   ```
3. Write your content in Markdown
4. Commit and push to GitHub
